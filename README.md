# MangoBattery

I always liked the CoconutBattery app on Mac OS X. The app allows you to see cycle count, battery health as a percentage compared to when it was relatively new, and charge/discharge rate in a nice, clean, simple way. On Windows, the most reliable way to get this information is by running powercfg /batteryreport and then inspecting the resulting report. However, sometimes I just want a quick glance at the current battery state without a full report. So, I decided to make an app and call it MangoBattery as a respectful nod to CoconutBattery on Mac OS.
